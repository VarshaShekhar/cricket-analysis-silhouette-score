## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **cricket player statistics** to identify **all-rounders**, perform **K-means clustering**, and visualize **player performance metrics**.

**Key Goals:**
1. **All-Rounder Identification:**  
   - Players with the **most runs** whose **wickets are above the median** among players with at least 1 wicket.
2. **K-Means Clustering:**  
   - Cluster players for **K = 2, 3, 4, 5**.
   - Evaluate clusters using **Silhouette Score**.
3. **Visualization:**  
   - Use **PCA** to reduce data to 2D.
   - Plot clusters and label sample points with **player names**.
   - Draw a **bar chart** showing silhouette scores.
4. **Player Categorization:**  
   - List players in each cluster and categorize them as **Batsman, Bowler, All-Rounder**, etc.
